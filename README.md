# IronHorn Scripture

**IronHorn Scripture** is a lore-driven, atmospheric static website presenting a fictional industrial–mythic universe of machines, doctrines, factions, and forbidden technology.

Built with **HTML and CSS**, the site emphasizes storytelling, typography, and visual immersion rather than functionality or commerce.

## 🌌 Concept & Theme

IronHorn Scripture explores a world where machines are not merely built — they are *recorded, archived, and revered*.  
Each section of the site functions as a fragment of a greater archive, documenting mechs, turbines, doctrines, relics, and factions that shape the Iron Wastes.

The tone blends:
- Industrial science fiction  
- Mythic doctrine  
- Military archival language  

This project is intended as a **world-building showcase** and **visual narrative experiment**.
